# Simple Spelling Bee Quizzer for Mac


## What and Why

Last Feb 2023, our school held our yearly 'Literary Month' where we would have a spelling bee! 

And the problem was, I couldn't really find someone to help review with me. (I had this vision of a tool that could speak out the spelling words for me to practice in random order, and I'd write it down and practice.)

I came across Tom White's GitHub program and thought that it was perfect â€” but the thing is, it didn't support Mac. 

So, I forked the program, and with a bit of help from trusty old ChatGPT, I modified the program to work on Mac using the native "speak" command. **I also added support for Mandarin Chinese!** (Because in our school, which is an international school, we also have Spelling Bee for Chinese too!)


### The result was a simple yet powerful Spelling Bee Quizzer that leverages the native commands on your Mac: _without any reliance on external APIs or the internet!_


*And...actually, I got first place for that year's Spelling Bee!



 
## How to Use

2. Navigate to the folder and edit ```words_cn.txt``` and ```words_en.txt```, replacing it with your actual words.


```words_en.txt``` should contain all the English vocabulary words that you are reviewing, ```words_cn.txt``` should contain all the Chinese vocabulary words. 

> [!NOTE]  
> If let's say, you only want to review English words, just leave the ```words_cn.txt``` file blank.


3. Open the Terminal application on your Mac and run the program!

Use the command ```sh bee.sh```




### And that's it! Happy reviewing!
