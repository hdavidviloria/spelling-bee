# Simple Spelling Bee Quizzer for Mac


## The Backstory

Around Feb 2023, our school held our yearly 'Literary Month' where we would have a spelling bee! And the problem was, I couldn't really find someone to help review with me. (I had this vision of a tool that could speak out the spelling words for me to practice in random order, and I'd write it down and practice.)

I came across Tom White's GitHub program and thought that it was perfect â€” but the thing is, it didn't support Mac. So, I forked the program, and with a bit of help from trusty old ChatGPT, I modified the program to work on Mac using the native "speak" command. **I also added support for Mandarin Chinese!** (Because in our school, which is an international school, we also have Spelling Bee for Chinese too!)


The result was a simple yet powerful Spelling Bee Quizzer that leverages the native commands on your Mac: without any reliance on external APIs or the internet!


*And...actually, I got first place for that year's Spelling Bee!
